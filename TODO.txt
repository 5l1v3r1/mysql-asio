Prepared statements
Multiresultset
	Text protocol
	Binary protocol (stored procedures)
Handshake
	sha256_password auth plugin: absence may cause BadUser tests to fail in 8.0
	SSL
	compression
Usability
	Incomplete query reads: how does this affect further queries?
	Metadata in rows: being able to index by name
	Iterators for sync resultset iteration
	Better interface for connection_params data structure
	Consideration of timezones
	Types
		Decimal
		Bit
		Geometry
	UNIX socket connection
Consider if header-only is a good idea
Technical debt
	Concept checking
	Review async initiations
		See if async_initiate is applicable
		See if we can drop the dependence on beast
		See if we can just declare the functions as auto
		Test things with other than futures
	Review close() of the stream on error
	Review valid() for moved-from resultsets (should it return always true?)
	Force the same number of values in each row as in fields()
	CMake exporting?
	Integration test for network errors (e.g. host unreachable)
